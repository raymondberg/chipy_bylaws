## ARTICLE VIII. – Conflict of Interest and Compensation

### Section 1: Purpose
The purpose of the conflict of interest policy is to protect this tax-exempt
organization’s (Organization) interest when it is contemplating entering into a
transaction or arrangement that might benefit the private interest of an
officer or director of the Organization or might result in a possible excess
benefit transaction. This policy is intended to supplement but not replace any
applicable state and federal laws governing conflict of interest applicable to
nonprofit and charitable organizations.

### Section 2: Definitions
  a.  Interested Person - Any director, principal officer, or member of a
      committee with governing board delegated powers, who has a direct or indirect
      financial interest, as defined below, is an interested person.
  b.  Financial Interest - A person has a financial interest if the person has,
      directly or indirectly, through business, investment, or family:
    1.  An ownership or investment interest in any entity with which the
        Organization has a transaction or arrangement,
    2.  A compensation arrangement with the Organization or with any entity or
        individual with which the Organization has a transaction or arrangement, or
    3.  A potential ownership or investment interest in, or compensation
        arrangement with, any entity or individual with which the Organization is
        negotiating a transaction or arrangement.

Compensation includes direct and indirect remuneration as well as gifts or
favors that are not insubstantial.

A financial interest is not necessarily a conflict of interest. Under Article
III, Section 2, a person who has a financial interest may have a conflict of
interest only if the appropriate governing board or committee decides that a
conflict of interest exists.

### Section 3. Procedures
  a.  Duty to Disclose. In connection with any actual or possible conflict of
      interest, an interested person must disclose the existence of the financial
      interest and be given the opportunity to disclose all material facts to the
      directors and members of committees with governing board delegated powers
      considering the proposed transaction or arrangement.
  b.  Determining Whether a Conflict of Interest Exists. After disclosure of
      the financial interest and all material facts, and after any discussion with
      the interested person, he/she shall leave the governing board or committee
      meeting while the determination of a conflict of interest is discussed and
      voted upon. The remaining board or committee members shall decide if a conflict
      of interest exists.
  c.  Procedures for Addressing the Conflict of Interest
    1.  An interested person may make a presentation at the governing board or
        committee meeting, but after the presentation, he/she shall leave the meeting
        during the discussion of, and the vote on, the transaction or arrangement
        involving the possible conflict of interest.
    2.  The chairperson of the governing board or committee shall, if
        appropriate, appoint a disinterested person or committee to investigate
        alternatives to the proposed transaction or arrangement.
    3.  After exercising due diligence, the governing board or committee shall
        determine whether the Organization can obtain with reasonable efforts a more
        advantageous transaction or arrangement from a person or entity that would not
        give rise to a conflict of interest.
    4.  If a more advantageous transaction or arrangement is not reasonably
        possible under circumstances not producing a conflict of interest, the
        governing board or committee shall determine by a majority vote of the
        disinterested directors whether the transaction or arrangement is in the
        Organization’s best interest, for its own benefit, and whether it is fair and
        reasonable. In conformity with the above determination it shall make its
        decision as to whether to enter into the transaction or arrangement.
  d.  Violations of the Conflicts of Interest Policy
    1.  If the governing board or committee has reasonable cause to believe a
        member has failed to disclose actual or possible conflicts of interest, it
        shall inform the member of the basis for such belief and afford the member an
        opportunity to explain the alleged failure to disclose.
    2.  If, after hearing the member’s response and after making further
        investigation as warranted by the circumstances, the governing board or
        committee determines the member has failed to disclose an actual or possible
        conflict of interest, it shall take appropriate disciplinary and corrective
        action.

### Section 4. Records of Proceedings
The minutes of the governing board and all committees with board delegated
powers shall contain:
  a.  The names of the persons who disclosed or otherwise were found to have a
      financial interest in connection with an actual or possible conflict of
      interest, the nature of the financial interest, any action taken to determine
      whether a conflict of interest was present, and the governing board’s or
      committee’s decision as to whether a conflict of interest in fact existed.
  b.  The names of the persons who were present for discussions and votes
      relating to the transaction or arrangement, the content of the discussion,
      including any alternatives to the proposed transaction or arrangement, and a
      record of any votes taken in connection with the proceedings.

### Section 5. Compensation
  a.  A voting member of the governing board who receives compensation,
      directly or indirectly, from the Organization for services is precluded from
      voting on matters pertaining to that member’s compensation.
  b.  A voting member of any committee whose jurisdiction includes compensation
      matters and who receives compensation, directly or indirectly, from the
      Organization for services is precluded from voting on matters pertaining to
      that member’s compensation.
  c.  No voting member of the governing board or any committee whose
      jurisdiction includes compensation matters and who receives compensation,
      directly or indirectly, from the Organization, either individually or
      collectively, is prohibited from providing information to any committee
      regarding compensation.

delegated powers shall annually sign a statement which affirms such person:
  a.  Has received a copy of the conflicts of interest policy,
  b.  Has read and understands the policy,

  d.  Understands the Organization is charitable and in order to maintain its
      federal tax exemption it must engage primarily in activities which accomplish
      one or more of its tax-exempt purposes.

### Section 7. Use of Outside Experts
When conducting the periodic reviews as provided for in Article VII, the
Organization may, but need not, use outside advisors. If outside experts are
used, their use shall not relieve the governing board of its responsibility for
ensuring periodic reviews are conducted.
